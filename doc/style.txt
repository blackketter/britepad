Style Guide
----------

Use function() instead of function(void)

Always use braces in if and else clauses, even if there's just a single statement in the clause

#defines should be ALLCAPS

Don't use #defines unless absolutely necessary

CamelCase is preferred for all symbols.

Class names should be capitalized.

Method, local variable and fields should have lower case initial caps

Non-class types should end with _t

Avoid long, long long, etc.  Use explicit length types (uint16_t) or, better yet, use data-specific types (color_t)

Using int is ok when it's a small counter or other number. (todo: seriously?)

Use bool when expressing a boolean value

if (variable) is ok for testing for zero

It's better to have symbols with descriptive titles than a comment
